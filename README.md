## File Organization Benefits

### Meaningful Names Strategy
**Purpose-Driven Naming**: Files named by function, not technical structure
- `quality-validation.md` (function) vs `linter_check.md` (technical)
- `al-development-guide.md` (purpose) vs `al_code.md` (technical)

**Workflow Context**: Files grouped by when they're used in AL development lifecycle
- Development phase files in [CoreDevelopment](CoreDevelopment/)
- Testing phase files in [TestingValidation](TestingValidation/)
- Cross-cutting standards in [SharedGuidelines](SharedGuidelines/)

### Enhanced Discoverability
**Multiple Navigation Paths**: Find content through:
- Workflow-based browsing ([CoreDevelopment](CoreDevelopment/) → specific files)
- Topic-based search (error handling → [SharedGuidelines/Standards/error-handling](SharedGuidelines/Standards/error-handling.md))
- Development phase navigation (testing → [TestingValidation](TestingValidation/))

**Cross-Reference Network**: Related content linked rather than duplicated
- Single source of truth in [SharedGuidelines](SharedGuidelines/)
- Workflow-specific guidance references shared standards
- Clear integration points between workflows

## Contributing Guidelines

### Maintaining the Structure

**Adding New Content:**
1. **Identify Workflow**: Determine which business workflow the content supports
2. **Check SharedGuidelines**: Verify if content is cross-cutting or workflow-specific
3. **Avoid Duplication**: Reference existing content rather than duplicating
4. **Maintain AL Headers**: Ensure all `.md` files have proper `applyTo: '**/*.al'`

**Modifying Existing Content:**
1. **Single Source Rule**: Only update content in its primary location
2. **Update Cross-References**: Verify all references to modified content remain accurate
3. **Test GitHub Copilot**: Ensure AI can still access and apply modified content
4. **Validate Links**: Check that all internal links continue to work

### Content Quality Standards
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: All content must support AI assistant integration
- **Meaningful Names**: File names must be purpose-driven and descriptive
