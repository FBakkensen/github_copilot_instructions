// Test Codeunit following TestingValidation naming conventions with X prefix
codeunit 50200 "X ABC Customer Tests"
{
    Subtype = Test;
    
    [Test]
    procedure TestCustomerCategoryValidation()
    var
        Customer: Record Customer;
    begin
        // Test data generation following test-data-patterns
        Customer."No." := 'X-CUST-001';  // X prefix for test isolation

page 50300 "ABC Customer API"
{
    PageType = API;
    EntityName = 'abcCustomer';
    EntitySetName = 'abcCustomers';
    SourceTable = Customer;
    DelayedInsert = true;
    
    layout

## Common Integration Challenges

### Challenge 1: Workflow Isolation vs. Integration Balance

#### Problem
Workflows become isolated despite integration documentation, leading to:
- Inconsistent standards application across different development phases
- Duplicate effort and rework between workflow transitions
- Quality degradation when workflows operate independently
- Integration points become theoretical rather than practical

#### Solution Pattern
**Practical Integration Checkpoints**
```markdown
Integration Validation Checklist:
- [ ] SharedGuidelines standards referenced and applied in current workflow
- [ ] Previous workflow outputs properly utilized as inputs
- [ ] Current workflow outputs designed to support subsequent workflows
- [ ] Cross-workflow compatibility validated through practical examples
- [ ] Integration points tested through realistic development scenarios
```

**Implementation Strategy**
1. **Mandatory Cross-References**: Require explicit references to SharedGuidelines in all workflow phases
2. **Output-Input Validation**: Validate that each workflow output properly supports subsequent workflow inputs
3. **Integration Testing**: Test workflow transitions through complete development scenarios
4. **Feedback Loops**: Implement feedback mechanisms from later workflows to improve earlier processes

### Challenge 2: Standards Consistency Across Workflows

#### Problem
Standards interpretation varies between workflows, resulting in:
- Inconsistent naming conventions application across development phases
- Varying error handling patterns between different workflow contexts
- Code style drift during optimization and publishing preparation
- Quality degradation during workflow transitions

#### Solution Pattern
**Authoritative Standards Reference System**
```markdown
Standards Hierarchy:
1. SharedGuidelines/Standards/ (Authoritative)
   ├── Referenced by all workflows without modification
   ├── Single source of truth for all standards questions
   └── Updated centrally with universal application

2. Workflow-Specific Guidance (Supplemental)
   ├── Builds upon SharedGuidelines foundation
   ├── Provides context-specific application examples
   └── Never contradicts authoritative standards
```

**Implementation Strategy**
1. **Centralized Standards Authority**: Maintain all core standards in SharedGuidelines with universal reference
2. **Consistent Reference Patterns**: Use identical reference formats across all workflows
3. **Standards Validation**: Include standards compliance validation in each workflow quality gate
4. **Regular Standards Review**: Periodically review standards consistency across all workflows

### Challenge 3: Quality Gate Effectiveness

#### Problem
Quality gates become bureaucratic checkpoints rather than value-adding validation, leading to:
- Workflow transitions without proper validation of readiness
- Quality degradation hidden by superficial quality gate compliance
- Development bottlenecks without corresponding quality improvement
- False confidence in quality progression through workflow phases

#### Solution Pattern
**Value-Driven Quality Gates**
```markdown
Quality Gate Design Principles:
1. **Measurable Criteria**: Specific, measurable exit criteria for each workflow
2. **Value Validation**: Quality gates validate real quality improvement
3. **Practical Application**: Quality gates tested through realistic scenarios
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Quality gate effectiveness measured and improved
```

**Implementation Strategy**
1. **Outcome-Focused Criteria**: Design quality gates around measurable quality outcomes
2. **Practical Validation**: Test quality gates through complete development scenarios
3. **Feedback Integration**: Use quality gate results to improve workflow processes
4. **Regular Effectiveness Review**: Assess and improve quality gate value contribution

### Challenge 4: Integration Documentation Maintenance

#### Problem
Integration documentation becomes outdated and disconnected from actual workflow practices:
- Documentation describes ideal integration that doesn't match practical application
- Cross-references become broken links without maintenance processes
- Integration examples become obsolete with workflow evolution
- Documentation overhead discourages workflow improvement and evolution

#### Solution Pattern
**Living Integration Documentation**
```markdown
Documentation Maintenance Strategy:
1. **Embedded Examples**: Integration documentation includes working code examples
2. **Automated Validation**: Cross-references validated through automated processes
3. **Regular Review Cycles**: Scheduled documentation review aligned with workflow evolution
4. **Community Contribution**: Documentation improvement through practical application feedback
```

**Implementation Strategy**
1. **Working Examples**: Include practical, tested examples in all integration documentation
2. **Reference Validation**: Implement automated checking of cross-workflow references
3. **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular documentation review and update cycles
4. **Feedback Integration**: Collect and incorporate feedback from practical workflow application
