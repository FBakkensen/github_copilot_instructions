- Should include all workflow quality requirements
- Should reference compliance and validation requirements

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ AppSource compliance requirements met
- ✅ All quality standards applied
- ✅ Documentation requirements included
- ✅ Validation steps completed

## Cross-Workflow Integration Testing

### Scenario: Complete Development Lifecycle

**Prompt**: Guide me through complete AL extension development from concept to AppSource

**Expected Workflow Integration**:
1. Start with `SharedGuidelines/Configuration/core-principles.instructions.md`
2. Move to `CoreDevelopment/` for object implementation
3. Apply `TestingValidation/` for quality assurance
4. Use `PerformanceOptimization/` for efficiency
5. Follow `IntegrationDeployment/` if needed
6. Complete with `AppSourcePublishing/` for marketplace

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ Logical workflow progression
- ✅ All quality standards applied throughout
- ✅ Proper transition guidance between phases
- ✅ Complete coverage of development lifecycle

## AI Assistant Configuration Testing

### GitHub Copilot Header Validation

**Test All Files Have Proper Headers**:
```bash
# Validate all instruction files have applyTo headers
find . -name "*.instructions.md" -exec grep -L "applyTo:" {} \;
```

**Expected Result**: No files should be listed (all should have headers)

### Content Accessibility Testing

**Test AI Can Access Cross-References**:
- Verify all `[link](file.md)` references are accessible
- Confirm relative paths work correctly
- Validate cross-workflow navigation functional

## Performance Testing for AI Integration

### Large Project Simulation

**Scenario**: AL project with 100+ objects across all workflows

**Testing Areas**:
- Navigation efficiency for specific guidelines
- Cross-reference resolution speed
- Content discovery through AI prompts
- Workflow integration guidance accessibility

### Expected Performance
- Quick access to relevant guidelines (< 2 navigation steps)
- Efficient cross-workflow reference resolution
- Fast content discovery through meaningful file names
- Scalable structure for large codebases
