# IntegrationDeployment - AL/Business Central Development Guidelines

## Workflow Purpose

IntegrationDeployment workflow provides comprehensive guidance for connecting AL applications with external systems and deploying solutions effectively. This workflow covers API integrations, accessibility standards, and deployment patterns that ensure robust, compliant AL applications.

## Scope and Coverage

This workflow addresses the following AL development areas:
- External system integration patterns and best practices
- API development and consumption in AL
- Accessibility standards and implementation
- Deployment strategies and environment management
- Integration testing and validation approaches

## Included Guidelines

### integration-patterns.instructions.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive patterns for integrating AL applications with external systems and Business Central components
**When to use**: When developing APIs, web services, external system connections, or internal Business Central integrations
**Key topics**:
- User experience integration patterns
- Event-based integration with publishers/subscribers
- API integration following RESTful principles
- External system integration with proper authentication
- Integration security best practices

### accessibility-standards.instructions.md
**Purpose**: Procedure accessibility standards for AL development to ensure testability and proper encapsulation
**When to use**: When designing AL procedures and codeunit structure for maintainable, testable code
**Key topics**:
- Internal vs local procedure accessibility rules
- Testability considerations for AL procedures
- Encapsulation balance between testing and security
- Best practices for test-friendly AL code design

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
1. **Identify your scenario**: Determine whether you're building integrations or ensuring accessibility compliance
2. **Select appropriate guideline**: Choose integration-patterns for external connections or accessibility-standards for UI compliance
3. **Apply systematically**: Follow the guidelines step-by-step for consistent, compliant results
4. **Cross-reference**: Check TestingValidation workflow for integration testing patterns

### Development Process Integration
- **Prerequisites**: CoreDevelopment fundamentals, understanding of target external systems
- **Dependencies**: SharedGuidelines for naming conventions and error handling patterns
- **Outputs**: Tested, accessible, and properly integrated AL components
- **Next steps**: PerformanceOptimization for integration performance tuning
