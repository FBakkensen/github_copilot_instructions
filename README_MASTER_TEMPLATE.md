## Navigation Guide

### Finding Specific Guidelines

**By Development Phase:**
- Starting new project ‚Üí CoreDevelopment
- Writing tests ‚Üí TestingValidation
- Adding integrations ‚Üí IntegrationDeployment
- Fixing performance ‚Üí PerformanceOptimization
- Publishing to AppSource ‚Üí AppSourcePublishing

**By Topic:**
- Object naming ‚Üí SharedGuidelines/Standards/naming-conventions
- Code formatting ‚Üí SharedGuidelines/Standards/code-style
- Error handling ‚Üí SharedGuidelines/Standards/error-handling
- Core principles ‚Üí SharedGuidelines/Configuration/core-principles

**Quick Reference:**
- All instruction files use `.instructions.md` extension for GitHub Copilot recognition
- Each workflow folder contains comprehensive README with file descriptions
- Cross-references link related content across workflows

## Workflow Integration

### Primary Workflow Connections
- **CoreDevelopment** ‚Üî **SharedGuidelines**: Core development uses shared standards
- **TestingValidation** ‚Üê **CoreDevelopment**: Testing validates development patterns
- **PerformanceOptimization** ‚Üê **CoreDevelopment**: Optimization improves development outcomes
- **AppSourcePublishing** ‚Üê **All Workflows**: Publishing requires compliance across all areas

### Transition Points
1. **Development ‚Üí Testing**: Move from CoreDevelopment to TestingValidation
2. **Testing ‚Üí Optimization**: Use TestingValidation results to guide PerformanceOptimization
3. **All ‚Üí Publishing**: Ensure AppSourcePublishing compliance throughout development
