# Standards - Shared Development Guidelines

## Purpose

The Standards directory contains core development standards that apply across all AL development workflows. These guidelines ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability across all Business Central development activities.

## Scope and Coverage

This directory provides shared standards for:
- Naming conventions for all AL objects and components
- Code style and formatting standards
- Error handling patterns and best practices
- Documentation and commenting standards
- Cross-workflow consistency requirements

## Included Guidelines

### naming-conventions.instructions.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive naming conventions for all AL objects, variables, and components
**When to use**: During all development activities to ensure consistent, meaningful names
**Key topics**: Object naming patterns, variable conventions, file naming standards

### code-style.instructions.md
**Purpose**: Code formatting, style, and structural standards for AL development
**When to use**: Throughout development to maintain consistent, readable code
**Key topics**: Indentation, spacing, commenting, code organization patterns

### error-handling.instructions.md
**Purpose**: Standardized error handling patterns and exception management
**When to use**: When implementing error handling, validation, or exception management
**Key topics**: Error message patterns, exception handling, validation strategies

## Usage Instructions

### Application Across Workflows
These standards apply to ALL development workflows:
- **CoreDevelopment**: Foundation standards for all AL objects
- **TestingValidation**: Consistent naming and error handling in test code
- **IntegrationDeployment**: Standard patterns for integration error handling
- **PerformanceOptimization**: Naming and style standards for optimized code
- **AppSourcePublishing**: Enhanced standards for marketplace compliance

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Reference First**: Check relevant standards before starting any development task
2. **Apply Consistently**: Use the same patterns across all code in your project
3. **Validate Regularly**: Review code against standards during development and code reviews
4. **Document Exceptions**: Any deviations from standards must be documented and justified

## Integration with Workflows

### Naming Conventions Integration
- **CoreDevelopment**: Object and procedure naming patterns
- **TestingValidation**: Test object and data naming standards
- **IntegrationDeployment**: API and integration component naming
- **PerformanceOptimization**: Performance-focused naming clarity
- **AppSourcePublishing**: Marketplace naming compliance

### Code Style Integration
- **All Workflows**: Consistent formatting and commenting standards
- **CoreDevelopment**: Code organization and structure patterns
- **TestingValidation**: Test code formatting and documentation
- **Shared Maintenance**: Easy code reading and maintenance across team

### Error Handling Integration
- **CoreDevelopment**: Business logic error handling patterns
- **TestingValidation**: Test failure and validation error patterns
- **IntegrationDeployment**: Integration and API error handling
- **PerformanceOptimization**: Performance-related error handling
- **AppSourcePublishing**: User-friendly error messages and handling

## Quick Reference

### Naming Essentials
- Use descriptive, meaningful names for all objects and variables
- Follow AL naming conventions consistently across all code
- Apply consistent prefixing and suffixing patterns
- Ensure names clearly indicate purpose and scope

### Style Essentials
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- Use clear, descriptive comments for complex logic
- Organize code logically with proper spacing
- Follow AL best practices for code structure

### Error Handling Essentials
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Handle exceptions gracefully without breaking user experience
- Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring
