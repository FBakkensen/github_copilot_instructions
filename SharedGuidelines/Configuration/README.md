# Configuration - AI Assistant and Core Guidelines

## Purpose

The Configuration directory contains foundational guidelines that configure AI assistant behavior and establish core development principles for AL/Business Central development. These guidelines ensure consistent AI assistance and establish fundamental development philosophies.

## Scope and Coverage

This directory provides configuration guidelines for:
- AI assistant behavior and instruction patterns
- Core development principles and methodologies
- GitHub Copilot optimization for AL development
- Fundamental AL development philosophies
- Cross-project consistency and approach standards

## Included Guidelines

### ai-assistant-guidelines.md
**Purpose**: Guidelines for AI assistants to provide optimal AL development support
**When to use**: Used by AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, etc.) to understand AL development context
**Key topics**: AL language patterns, Business Central concepts, development assistance patterns

### core-principles.md
**Purpose**: Fundamental AL development principles and methodologies
**When to use**: As foundation for all development activities and decision-making
**Key topics**: Development philosophy, quality principles, architectural guidance

## Usage Instructions

### AI Assistant Integration
These guidelines ensure AI assistants provide:
